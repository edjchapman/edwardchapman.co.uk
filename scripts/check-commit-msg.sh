# Validate a commit subject against the Conventional Commits standard.
#
# Closes the commit "type" vocabulary to a Conventional Commits grammar with a
# fixed set (edit TYPES below to taste):
#
#     <type>[(<scope>)][!]: <subject>
#
#   type   required, lowercase, from the closed set below
#   scope  optional, lowercase slug — a sub-area, e.g. build(makefile);
#          regex [a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*
#   !      optional, marks a breaking change
#   subject  required free text
#
# WHERE IT RUNS
#   - .githooks/commit-msg passes the commit message FILE as $1 (local).
#   - .github/workflows/commit-style.yml pipes the PR TITLE via --stdin (CI).
#     When you squash-merge, the PR title becomes the permanent commit subject —
#     so that is the thing worth validating. Per-branch WIP commits are not
#     range-validated; they are squashed away.
#
# WARN-ONLY FIRST
#   Default behaviour prints a WARN: line and exits 0, matching the repo's
#   incremental-validation pattern (new checks ship warn-only, harden after an
#   adjustment runway). Pass --strict to turn a non-conforming subject into a
#   hard failure (exit 1). PROMOTION TODO: once commits have followed the
#   standard for a few weeks, add --strict to both the commit-msg hook and the
#   commit-style CI workflow to make it blocking.
#
# USAGE
#   ./scripts/check-commit-msg.sh <commit-msg-file>     # hook mode
#   printf '%s\n' "$SUBJECT" | ./scripts/check-commit-msg.sh --stdin
#   ./scripts/check-commit-msg.sh --stdin --strict      # hard-fail mode
